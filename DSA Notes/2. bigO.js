/*  O(n):
        Signifies that the execution time of the algorithm grows "linearly" in proportion to the 
        size of the input data(n).In simple terms, as the number of items in the input data increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run increases correspondingly.*/
/*  O(1):
        Signifies that the execution time of the algorithm remains "constant" regardless of the input size. */
/*  O(n^2):
        The algorithm's execution time grows "quadratically" with the size of the input data(n). */
/*  O(log n)
        This refers to an algorithm's runtime that grown logarithmically with the size of the input(n).
        In simple terms, as the input size increases, the times it takes for the algorithm it run increases "slowly". */
